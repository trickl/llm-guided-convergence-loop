# Examples

This directory contains applied workflows for the Guided Convergence Loop.

The examples are written to be adapted into:
- prompting templates,
- agent pipelines,
- or human-in-the-loop operational playbooks.

Each example focuses on:
- what inputs to provide,
- what artifacts to ask for,
- what constraints to enforce,
- what checks to run,
- and what convergence looks like.
